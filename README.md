### Solving Raven's Progressive Matrices Test Using Affine Transformations ###

This Java application attempts to solve Raven's Progressive Matrices (RPM) test by implementing the affine transformation method proposed by Dr. Maithilee Kunda of the Georgia Institute of Technology. To learn more about the RPM test and the scope of this application read the 'project-description.pdf' file located in this repository.

To learn more about the affine transformation method read the following papers by Dr. Kunda:
